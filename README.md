# ✨ Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Handwritten Digits Generation ✨

## **Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using **Keras** to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits similar to those in the **MNIST dataset**. GANs consist of two neural networks — the **generator** and the **discriminator** — that are trained simultaneously through an adversarial process, where the generator tries to create realistic images, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images.

## **Components**

### **MNIST Dataset**

- The **MNIST dataset** consists of:
  - **60,000 training images** and **10,000 testing images** of handwritten digits (0-9).
  - Each image is a **28x28 grayscale** image.

### **Generator Network**

- The **generator** network takes **random noise** as input and generates images that resemble handwritten digits.
- Key layers and components used:
  - **Dense Layer**: To transform the random noise.
  - **BatchNormalization**: To stabilize training and improve performance.
  - **ReLU Activation**: To introduce non-linearity and help learning.
  - **Tanh Activation**: Produces images in the range **[-1, 1]**.

### **Discriminator Network**

- The **discriminator** network takes an image as input and classifies it as either **real** (from the dataset) or **fake** (generated by the generator).
- Key layers and components used:
  - **Conv2D Layer**: To extract features from images.
  - **LeakyReLU Activation**: To introduce non-linearity and avoid dead neurons.
  - **Dropout**: Regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - **Sigmoid Activation**: Outputs a probability indicating if the image is real or fake.

## **Training Process**

- The generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial setup:
  - **Generator**: Attempts to create images that fool the discriminator.
  - **Discriminator**: Tries to distinguish between real and fake images.
  
  This process continues until the generator produces convincing images that the discriminator cannot reliably distinguish from real ones.
