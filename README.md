The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Keras to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. GANs consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial processes.

Components:

MNIST Dataset:

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image.

Generator:

The generator network takes random noise as input and generates images that resemble handwritten digits.
It typically uses layers like Dense, BatchNormalization, and ReLU activations, followed by a final Tanh activation layer to produce images in the range [-1, 1].

Discriminator:

The discriminator network takes an image as input and outputs the probability that the image is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).
It usually comprises layers like Conv2D, LeakyReLU activations, and Dropout for regularization, followed by a final Sigmoid activation layer.
