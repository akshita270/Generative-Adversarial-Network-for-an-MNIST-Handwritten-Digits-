🎨 Handwritten Digit Generation with GANs | MNIST
🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Keras to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. By leveraging adversarial training, the model learns to produce high-quality synthetic digits that closely mimic real ones.

📌 How It Works
GANs consist of two neural networks, trained simultaneously in a competitive setting:

🔹 Generator (The Artist 🎭)
Takes random noise as input and generates images that resemble handwritten digits.
Uses Dense layers, BatchNormalization, ReLU activations, and a final Tanh activation to produce images in the range [-1, 1].
Continuously improves as it fools the discriminator into believing the generated digits are real.
🔹 Discriminator (The Critic 🕵️)
Distinguishes between real MNIST images and fake ones generated by the generator.
Built with Conv2D, LeakyReLU activations, and Dropout layers to enhance robustness.
Outputs a probability score using a Sigmoid activation function to classify images as real or fake.
🖼️ Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits
60,000 training images + 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Each image is a 28×28 grayscale representation of a digit.
🔥 Why This Matters
GANs have revolutionized image generation, style transfer, and data augmentation. This project serves as a stepping stone to understanding:
✅ How GANs generate realistic images
✅ Adversarial training techniques
✅ Deep learning architectures for image synthesis
